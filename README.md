# Blazor Web Assembly Project - Recipe App

This project is a web-based application for creating, editing, and storing recipes. The app is built using Blazor Web Assembly, a framework for building client-side web applications with .NET and C#. With this app, users can easily add new recipes, edit existing ones, and view a list of all their recipes in one convenient location.

# Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

1.  To provide a user-friendly web application for managing and organizing recipes.
2.  To utilize the capabilities of Blazor Web Assembly and C# to build a responsive and interactive app.
3.  To create a platform for storing and accessing recipes from any device with an internet connection.

# Progression

On 8 January 2023, the following progress was made on the recipe app:

- The "add recipe", "edit recipe", and "list of recipe" pages were implemented and added to the navbar

On 9 January 2023, further development was completed on the "add recipe" page, which now includes a form with fields for the name of the recipe, ingredients, and time needed to complete the recipe, as well as an "add recipe" button. A screenshot of this page can be seen below:

On 14 January 2023, the data is now stored in the LocalStorage. When submitting the recipe, the data is stored in an array.
So when we refresh the page, the data will be visible. The data are no longer volatile.
